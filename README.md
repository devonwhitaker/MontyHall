# MontyHall

This project simulates the famous **Monty Hall Problem**.

---

## The Problem

You're on a game show with **three doors**:
- Behind one door is a **car** (the prize).
- Behind the other two are **goats**.

You pick a door (say Door 1).  
The host, who knows what's behind each door, opens another door (say Door 3) — revealing a **goat**.  

You’re then asked:  
> Do you want to stick with your original choice, or switch to the remaining unopened door?

Intuition says it’s 50/50...  
 **Reality says: switching wins 2/3 of the time.**

## What This Project Does

This simulation:
- Runs thousands of trials of the Monty Hall game
- Compares the win rate of **staying** vs **switching**
- Provides a visual breakdown of the results
- Reinforces why switching doors gives a statistical edge
